# Product-Analytics
## Project Overview
## Implementing a Performance Monitoring Dashboard to Monitor User Adoption and Engagement on VendBridge App
#### In this project, I explored how product analytics can be used to evaluate the performance and user engagement of VendBridge, a digital marketplace app launched by NexaLink. The aim was to understand how users are interacting with the app and identify what’s working, what’s not, and where improvements can be made. I used Tableau as the main tool for analysis and dashboard creation, working with a dataset that included daily active users, installations, sign-ups, transaction counts, app crashes, and time spent per user. I defined key product KPIs, built calculated fields, and designed a dashboard to give the product team clear visibility into how VendBridge is performing since its launch.
